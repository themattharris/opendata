Model inputs of cloud amounts and other atmospheric state parameters are also available in some of the data sets. Primary inputs to the models include: visible and infrared radiances from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) pixel-level (DX) data, cloud and surface properties derived from those data, temperature and moisture profiles from GEOS-4 reanalysis product obtained from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), and column ozone amounts constituted from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) archives, and Stratospheric Monitoring-group\xE2\x80\x99s Ozone Blended Analysis (SMOBA), an assimilation product from NOAA\xE2\x80\x99s Climate Prediction Center. SRB products are reformatted for the use of renewable energy and agricultural communities and made available through the Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) website. SRB products now overlap a portion of surface and TOA flux data sets that are available from Clouds and the Earth\xE2\x80\x99s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project. These CERES data products and those from the CERES Fast Longwave and SHortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) project extend past the SRB time frame. The latter project provides radiative fluxes on a near real-time basis. The CERES and CERES/FLASHFlux data sets also make use of global observations from Moderate-resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) instruments."

  content: "This compilation of outgassing data of materials intended for spacecraft use were obtained at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), utilizing equipment developed at Stanford Research Institue (SRI) under contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n\
    SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. Their report (Reference 1), which contained data from June 1964 to August 1967, served well as a foundation for selecting spacecraft materials with low outgassing properties. The apparatus was also constructed at GSFC and, based on the SRI data and GSFC data, a GSFC report (Reference 2) was published. That report included data for those materials meeting two criteria: a maximum total mass loss (TML) of 1.0 percent and maximum collected volatile condensable material (CVCM) of 0.10 percent.\n\
    After a series of tests and verification of procedures, an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Test Method was developed, based upon this apparatus. The method, \xE2\x80\x9CTotal Mass Loss (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment,\xE2\x80\x9D is identified as E 595-77/84/90. The data developed through the years have been reported in References 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as a means of assisting in selecting materials for space flight use."

  content: "Satellite-derived Ocean Color Data sets from historical and currently operational NASA and International Satellite missions including the NASA Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) (1978 \xE2\x80\x93 1986), NASDA\xE2\x80\x99s Ocean Color Temperature Scanner (OCTS) (1996 \xE2\x80\x93 1997), NASA/GeoEYE Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (1997 \xE2\x80\x93 2010), NASA\xE2\x80\x99s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua spacecraft (2000 \xE2\x80\x93 present) and ESA\xE2\x80\x99s medium-spectral resolution, imaging spectrometer (MERIS) (2002 \xE2\x80\x93 present).\n\
    Level-1A Data Products\n\
    Level-1A products contain the raw radiance counts from all bands as well as spacecraft and instrument telemetry. Calibration and navigation data, and instrument and selected spacecraft telemetry are also included. Level-1A data are used as input for geolocation, calibration, and processing.\n\
    Ocean Level-2 Data Products\n\
    Each Level-2 product is generated from a corresponding Level-1A product.The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel,derived from the Level-1A raw radiance counts by applying the sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1A product and is stored in one physical HDFfile.\n\
    Ocean Level-3 Binned Data Products\n\
    Level-3 binned data products consist of the accumulated data for all Level-2 data corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, or a calendar year.\n\
    Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. Each multi-file product includes a main file containing all product-level metadata and data for each bin that are common to all the binned geophysical parameters, and multiple subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file.\n\
    Ocean Level-3 Standard Mapped Image Products\n\
    The Level-3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are image representations of binned data products generated from SeaWiFS, MODIS, OCTS or CZCS data. The data in each SMI product represents an image of the parameter specified by the global attribute Parameter. This object is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or 4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base, Slope, and Intercept.\n\
    The standard SMI products are generated from binned data products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration, angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength, aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file."

The digital archive, however, offers many improvements upon its original hardbound predecessor. Multiple search capabilities were added to the database to expedite locating images and features of interest. For accuracy and usability, surface feature information has been updated and improved. Lastly, to aid in feature identification, a companion image containing feature annotation has been included.

    IRSA is chartered to curate the calibrated science products from NASAs infrared and sub-millimeter missions, including five major large-area/all-sky surveys. IRSA data sets are cited in about 10% of astronomical refereed papers.
    IRSA offers access to digital archives through powerful query engines, including VO-compliant interfaces, and offers unique tools such as the IRAS scan processing tool Scanpi. IRSA exploits a re-useable architecture to deploy cost-effective archives for customers, including: the Spitzer Space Telescope; the 2MASS and IRAS all-sky surveys; and multi-mission datasets such as COSMOS. In the near future, IRSA will serve public data from the WISE all-sky survey and the Planck mission.

  content: "The Clouds and the Earth\xE2\x80\x99s Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth\xE2\x80\x99s atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999, and two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002."
