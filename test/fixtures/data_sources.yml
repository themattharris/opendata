  content: "The NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Release-3.0 data sets contains global 3-hourly, daily, monthly/3-hourly, and monthly averages of surface and top-of atmosphere (TOA) longwave and shortwave radiative parameters on a 1\xC3\x82\xC2\xB0x1\xC3\x82\xC2\xB0 grid. Model inputs of cloud amounts and other atmospheric state parameters are also available in some of the data sets. Primary inputs to the models include: visible and infrared radiances from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) pixel-level (DX) data, cloud and surface properties derived from those data, temperature and moisture profiles from GEOS-4 reanalysis product obtained from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), and column ozone amounts constituted from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) archives, and Stratospheric Monitoring-group\xE2\x80\x99s Ozone Blended Analysis (SMOBA), an assimilation product from NOAA\xE2\x80\x99s Climate Prediction Center. SRB products are reformatted for the use of renewable energy and agricultural communities and made available through the Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) website. SRB products now overlap a portion of surface and TOA flux data sets that are available from Clouds and the Earth\xE2\x80\x99s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project. These CERES data products and those from the CERES Fast Longwave and SHortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) project extend past the SRB time frame. The latter project provides radiative fluxes on a near real-time basis. The CERES and CERES/FLASHFlux data sets also make use of global observations from Moderate-resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) instruments."

The following websites are tracking the day-by-day increase in new discoveries and are providing information on the characteristics of the planets as well as those of the stars they orbit: The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, NASA Exoplanet Archive, New Worlds Atlas, and Current Planet Count Widget.\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0The challenge now is to find terrestrial planets (i.e., those one half to twice the size of the Earth), especially those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. The Kepler Mission, NASA Discovery mission #10, is specifically designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky Way galaxy\xC2\xA0to discover dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets. Results from this mission will allow us to place our solar system within the continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy."

  created_at: 2011-08-31 19:50:59
  content: "This compilation of outgassing data of materials intended for spacecraft use were obtained at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), utilizing equipment developed at Stanford Research Institue (SRI) under contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n\
    SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. Their report (Reference 1), which contained data from June 1964 to August 1967, served well as a foundation for selecting spacecraft materials with low outgassing properties. The apparatus was also constructed at GSFC and, based on the SRI data and GSFC data, a GSFC report (Reference 2) was published. That report included data for those materials meeting two criteria: a maximum total mass loss (TML) of 1.0 percent and maximum collected volatile condensable material (CVCM) of 0.10 percent.\n\
    After a series of tests and verification of procedures, an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Test Method was developed, based upon this apparatus. The method, \xE2\x80\x9CTotal Mass Loss (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment,\xE2\x80\x9D is identified as E 595-77/84/90. The data developed through the years have been reported in References 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as a means of assisting in selecting materials for space flight use."

    Level-1A Data Products\n\
    Level-1A products contain the raw radiance counts from all bands as well as spacecraft and instrument telemetry. Calibration and navigation data, and instrument and selected spacecraft telemetry are also included. Level-1A data are used as input for geolocation, calibration, and processing.\n\
    Ocean Level-2 Data Products\n\
    Each Level-2 product is generated from a corresponding Level-1A product.The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel,derived from the Level-1A raw radiance counts by applying the sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1A product and is stored in one physical HDFfile.\n\
    Ocean Level-3 Binned Data Products\n\
    Level-3 binned data products consist of the accumulated data for all Level-2 data corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, or a calendar year.\n\
    Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. Each multi-file product includes a main file containing all product-level metadata and data for each bin that are common to all the binned geophysical parameters, and multiple subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file.\n\
    Ocean Level-3 Standard Mapped Image Products\n\
    The Level-3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are image representations of binned data products generated from SeaWiFS, MODIS, OCTS or CZCS data. The data in each SMI product represents an image of the parameter specified by the global attribute Parameter. This object is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or 4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base, Slope, and Intercept.\n\
    The standard SMI products are generated from binned data products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration, angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength, aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file."

  title: Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) Data
  created_at: 2011-08-26 10:23:10
  content: "TES focuses on the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that stretches from the ground to the altitude at which airplanes fly. With very high spectral resolution, TES can distinguish concentrations of gases at different altitudes, a key factor in understanding their behavior and impact. It\xE2\x80\x99s the first orbiting instrument able to do this with ozone, a very important chemical with regard to both global warming and air pollution.\n\
    The primary location for obtaining TES data is NASA\xE2\x80\x99s Warehouse Inventory Search Tool (WIST). The TES Data Sets page at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC ASDC) provides access to software read tools, a Data Pool, and supporting documentation."

  content: "The Lessons Learned program delivers the agency-wide Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS) where employees can search vetted lessons and submit lessons. The program is a cornerstone of NASA as a learning organization and is supported by employees like you. NASA lessons evolve from positive and negative outcomes experienced during the course of doing NASA work. It is important to share with others across the agency\xC2\xA0\xE2\x80\x94 to avoid (if a negative outcome) or support (if a positive outcome) similar situations in the future, thus ensuring that NASA\xC2\xA0learns from past successes and mistakes."
