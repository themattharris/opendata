    <p>The Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon is considered the definitive reference manual to the global photographic coverage of the Moon. The images contained within the atlas are excellent for studying lunar morphology because they were obtained at low to moderate Sun angles. The digital Lunar Orbiter Atlas of the Moon is a reproduction of the 675 plates contained in Bowker and Hughes. The digital archive, however, offers many improvements upon its original hardbound predecessor. Multiple search capabilities were added to the database to expedite locating images and features of interest. For accuracy and usability, surface feature information has been updated and improved. Lastly, to aid in feature identification, a companion image containing feature annotation has been included.</p>

    <p>The Lessons Learned program delivers the agency-wide Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS) where employees can search vetted lessons and submit lessons. The program is a cornerstone of NASA as a learning organization and is supported by employees like you. NASA lessons evolve from positive and negative outcomes experienced during the course of doing NASA work. It is important to share with others across the agency&#160;&#8212; to avoid (if a negative outcome) or support (if a positive outcome) similar situations in the future, thus ensuring that NASA&#160;learns from past successes and mistakes.</p>

    <p>The Lunar Orbiter Photo Gallery is an extensive collection of over 2,600 high- and moderate-resolution photographs produced by all five of the Lunar Orbiter missions. These photographs were taken in 1966 and 1967 to survey possible lunar landing sites and provide baseline imagery for geologic analysis of the lunar surface. The images were used to select the Apollo landing sites and to produce many of our existing lunar geologic maps. This photo gallery is the web&#8217;s most comprehensive collection of Lunar Orbiter photography and supporting documents.</p>

    <p>TES focuses on the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that stretches from the ground to the altitude at which airplanes fly. With very high spectral resolution, TES can distinguish concentrations of gases at different altitudes, a key factor in understanding their behavior and impact. It&#8217;s the first orbiting instrument able to do this with ozone, a very important chemical with regard to both global warming and air pollution.<br />
    The primary location for obtaining TES data is NASA&#8217;s Warehouse Inventory Search Tool (WIST). The TES Data Sets page at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC ASDC) provides access to software read tools, a Data Pool, and supporting documentation.</p>

    <p>Apollo Surface Panoramas is a digital library of photographic panoramas that the Apollo astronauts took while exploring the Moon&#8217;s surface. These images provide a spectacular boots-on-the-ground view of the lunar landscape. The panoramas are stitched together from individual <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/catalog/70mm/">70mm Hasselblad frames</a>, each of which is also accessible through this new atlas. Lunar surface features captured in the panoramas can be studied using zoom and pan tools. An annotated version of each panorama is also available to assist users with the identification of major geographic features around each Apollo landing site.</p>

    <p>SDO: The Solar Dynamics Observatory is the first mission to be launched for NASA&#8217;s Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand the Sun&#8217;s influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.</p>
    <p>SDO&#8217;s goal is to understand, driving towards a predictive capability, the solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity&#8217;s technological systems by determining how the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field is generated and structured and how this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere and geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance.</p>

    <p>The Clouds and the Earth&#8217;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999, and two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002.</p>

    <p>The centuries-old quest for other worlds like our Earth has been rejuvenated by the intense excitement and popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. There is now clear evidence for substantial numbers of three types of exoplanets; gas giants, hot-super-Earths in short period orbits, and ice giants. The following websites are tracking the day-by-day increase in new discoveries and are providing information on the characteristics of the planets as well as those of the stars they orbit: The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, NASA Exoplanet Archive, New Worlds Atlas, and Current Planet Count Widget.&#160;&#160;The challenge now is to find terrestrial planets (i.e., those one half to twice the size of the Earth), especially those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. The Kepler Mission, NASA Discovery mission #10, is specifically designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky Way galaxy&#160;to discover dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets. Results from this mission will allow us to place our solar system within the continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy.</p>

Model inputs of cloud amounts and other atmospheric state parameters are also available in some of the data sets. Primary inputs to the models include: visible and infrared radiances from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) pixel-level (DX) data, cloud and surface properties derived from those data, temperature and moisture profiles from GEOS-4 reanalysis product obtained from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), and column ozone amounts constituted from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) archives, and Stratospheric Monitoring-group&#8217;s Ozone Blended Analysis (SMOBA), an assimilation product from NOAA&#8217;s Climate Prediction Center. SRB products are reformatted for the use of renewable energy and agricultural communities and made available through the Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) website. SRB products now overlap a portion of surface and TOA flux data sets that are available from Clouds and the Earth&#8217;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project. These CERES data products and those from the CERES Fast Longwave and SHortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) project extend past the SRB time frame. The latter project provides radiative fluxes on a near real-time basis.

    <p>This compilation of outgassing data of materials intended for spacecraft use were obtained at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), utilizing equipment developed at Stanford Research Institue (SRI) under contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</p>
    <p>SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. Their report (Reference 1), which contained data from June 1964 to August 1967, served well as a foundation for selecting spacecraft materials with low outgassing properties. The apparatus was also constructed at GSFC and, based on the SRI data and GSFC data, a GSFC report (Reference 2) was published. That report included data for those materials meeting two criteria: a maximum total mass loss (TML) of 1.0 percent and maximum collected volatile condensable material (CVCM) of 0.10 percent.</p>
    <p>After a series of tests and verification of procedures, an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Test Method was developed, based upon this apparatus. The method, &#8220;Total Mass Loss (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment,&#8221; is identified as E 595-77/84/90. The data developed through the years have been reported in References 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as a means of assisting in selecting materials for space flight use.</p>

    <p>Beginning with the systematic mapping of the lunar surface more than three decades ago, this database contains over 1600 maps of the planets and satellites of the Solar System. This collection of maps is a unique resource that has been derived from images and data returned by a series of space missions. Many of the maps have not been replicated or updated with data from new missions, and thus they represent a very special legacy from the beginnings of space exploration. The total map database includes controlled photomosaics, geologic maps, shaded relief portrayals, topographic maps, and panoramas of the martian surface.</p>

    <p>Satellite-derived Ocean Color Data sets from historical and currently operational NASA and International Satellite missions including the NASA Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) (1978 &#8211; 1986), NASDA&#8217;s Ocean Color Temperature Scanner (OCTS) (1996 &#8211; 1997), NASA/GeoEYE Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (1997 &#8211; 2010), NASA&#8217;s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua spacecraft (2000 &#8211; present) and ESA&#8217;s medium-spectral resolution, imaging spectrometer (MERIS) (2002 &#8211; present).</p>
    <p><strong>Level-1A Data Products</strong><br />
    Level-1A products contain the raw radiance counts from all bands as well as spacecraft and instrument telemetry. Calibration and navigation data, and instrument and selected spacecraft telemetry are also included. Level-1A data are used as input for geolocation, calibration, and processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Ocean Level-2 Data Products</strong><br />
    Each Level-2 product is generated from a corresponding Level-1A product.The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel,derived from the Level-1A raw radiance counts by applying the sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1A product and is stored in one physical HDFfile.</p>
    <p><strong>Ocean Level-3 Binned Data Products</strong><br />
    Level-3 binned data products consist of the accumulated data for all Level-2 data corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, or a calendar year.</p>
    <p>Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. Each multi-file product includes a main file containing all product-level metadata and data for each bin that are common to all the binned geophysical parameters, and multiple subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file.</p>
    <p><strong>Ocean Level-3 Standard Mapped Image Products</strong><br />
    The Level-3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are image representations of binned data products generated from SeaWiFS, MODIS, OCTS or CZCS data. The data in each SMI product represents an image of the parameter specified by the global attribute Parameter. This object is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or 4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base, Slope, and Intercept.</p>
    <p>The standard SMI products are generated from binned data products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration, angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength, aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file.</p>
